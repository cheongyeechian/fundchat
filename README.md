**A place For You To Chat Before You Make Transaction**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

❓Problem Statement❓: People always send wrong funds to the wrong account, so before they transfer fund, they will transfer some little funds 
                    first. But Its so inconvenient to transfer money twice.
                    
💡Solution💡: Send msg request to the address first, before you send funds.  

🤔What we do🤔: A platform to chat and transfer fund to all Solana address.
